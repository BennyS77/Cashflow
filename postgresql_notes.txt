Cloud SQL - PostgreSQL

    - connect using Cloud SQL Auth proxy
    - for development purposes, not production

To start the Cloud SQL Auth proxy:  (current it's within the Django_old directory)
    ./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=aged-receivables-111:australia-southeast1:my-pgresqp=tcp:5432

To connect to 'test_database' using psql (ie from the command line)
    psql "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 sslmode=disable dbname=test_database user=postgres"
(np22)


A database would typically contain multiple tables that are 'related' to each other.
The schema of the database would define how they are related.

The general idea:
    When a user logs in, if its a new project, setup initial data with Odata, etc, then
    save table data to database. Will work directly with this data from hereon (aggrid etc)
    If project already exists, retrieve table data from database (for aggrid etc)


Data that is to persist between sessions and between user-envoked updates.
    - Cost Group
    - Cost Item
    - EAC
    - ACTD
    - startDate
    - endDate
    - forecastMethod
    - 'actuals'
    - monthly percentages for 'Manual' forecast methods.



Initially: just set up a single table. eg Cost data.
