Adding a key makes it do some very weird things.

if reload_data=True
    - change made to a cell value does not persist until the rerun button in clicked.
    - the difference is detected though and the update is made correctly.
    - Looks like it reloads data when the rerun is triggered
        - data is only changed at the end of event-triggered rerun.
    - reload=False will not reload data automatically - the option we want for this.
        - actually, doesnt really matter because the rest of the calculated data is only updated
            after the manual rerun

editing the start or end date is causing the grid to freak out
