Key and data_reload

According to Pablo:
    """ Setting a fixed key will prevent the grid to reinitialize when
        dataframe parameter changed.
        Data will only refresh when reload_data = True """

Key
So, if the dataframe that Ag-grid loads is fixed (ie remains unchanged upon rerun), 
using a key will make no difference. It's only when the dataframe changes. 

data_reload
After an interaction with the grid (eg cell edit), the dataframe will be reloaded
into the grid. This will cause any edits to be replaced with the dataframe values.
If we want the change to the grid to persist, set data_reload = False.
NOTE: editing the grid in no-way changes the dataframe data that is loaded into it.

So
    reload_data = True
         - the grid response will include the changed value, but the grid will reload the
            dataframe and so will look different to the grid output.

    reload_data = False
        - the grid_reponse still includes the changed value, but the value persists in
            grid itself because the dataframe is not being reloaded.


grid response
The grid response will only include the columns of the dataframe loaded into it.
Any columns only defined in gridOptions (eg calculated columns) will not be in the response.

User-changeable values that will need to be updated and loaded back into the grid:
    - forecast method.
    - start date / end date
    - forecast monthly percentages
